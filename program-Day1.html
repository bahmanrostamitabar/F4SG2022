          <div class="card-body">Supply chain management of health programs (financing, technical assistance, support, etc.) 
  tend to be siloed and fall within the following health areas: 
  HIV/AIDS, TB, malaria, sexual and reproductive health, 
  neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), non-communicable diseases
  (NCDs), and vaccines. Introduction of the COVID-19 vaccine 
  required different forecasting methodologies than is 
  typically used in immunization programs due to the different
  target populations and service delivery strategies. 
  This presentation will review the methodologies that 
  health programs currently use for forecasting and 
  supply planning for program related pharmaceuticals 
  and supplies and how they vary across health areas. 
  The presentation will further review how the differing
  strategies for immunization programs, such as focus on 
  children, goals and aggregated consumption, needed to be
  adapted and updated for forecasting for the COVID-19 
  vaccines. The presentation will also examine how the 
  different methodologies are driven by the differences 
  in goals, data reporting, and collections structures. 
  Lessons learned from adapting for the COVID-19 vaccines 
  will be discussed as possible solutions and strategies 
  for country immunization teams to adapt how they forecast 
  for childhood/routine immunization. As other adult, 
  non-target based vaccines come on to the market, 
  alternate forecasting methodologies can build on 
  lessons learned across health program areas to 
  provide more accurate forecasts for vaccines.</div>

          <div class="card-body">JSI has been leading an effort with other partners to strengthen supply planning capacity by LMICs for COVID-19 vaccines. A standardized tool has been developed that captures complete shipment, inventory and consumption data from currently 15 countries. 
This initiative, called the COVID-19 Vaccine Collaborative 
Supply Planning (CSP), is partnered with ministries of health
in 15 countries, PATH, VillageReach, WFP, CHAI, inSupplyHealth
, and JSH. The initiative has two main goals: 
1) Work closely with partners to provide surge capacity to 
help countries collect, aggregate, and triangulate 
various sets of data, and support them to translate 
these data into systems to support more agile and 
responsive COVID-19 vaccine supply decisions, 
particularly around the timing and quantity of 
needed shipments; and 
2) Strengthen country capacity for supply planning, 
and improve data visibility and processes for supply 
planning at the global, regional, and country level 
for routine immunization as well. 
This presentation will review the successes and 
challenges to the second goal. Topics will include success 
and challenges to ownership and governance, 
data use policy, conflicts of interest, 
partner engagement, and global-level 
visibility for decision making. The presentation will also
review similar success and challenges to country level 
Visibility and Analytics (VAN) development in for 
vaccines and how lessons learned from these efforts
can be applied to the global level.</div>

While some displacement ‘events’ are relatively small in number, others are large and long lasting.  We develop a model to forecast human displacement using a hurdle model; a model that allows us to distinguish between small and large events.  This model provides support for existing work that finds an important effect of armed conflict; the effect(s) of climate change are weaker.

          <div class="card-body">Following the rapid increase of asylum seekers arriving in the European Union in 2015/16, policymakers have invested heavily in improving their foresight and forecasting capabilities. While expert opinion is increasingly solicited, its added value has been questioned. First, we provide expert predictions of immigration to the European Union in 2030 separately for four scenarios and five groups of immigrants. Second, we evaluate the internal consistency of expert estimates and compare them to alternative time series forecasts. We conducted a two-round Delphi survey with 178 migration experts to estimate the size of future international immigration flows. The results are presented descriptively and the impact of expert composition on estimates dispersion is evaluated using regression analysis. We also produce alternative forecasts of immigration using linear extrapolations and an ARIMA model. Results show that experts expect total immigration to increase by 21-44% relative to 2008-17. High-skilled and labour immigration are predicted to increase most notably whereas irregular and forced immigration depend on different scenarios but are generally expected to remain lower than in 2015/16. Despite several efforts to improve reliability, experts tend to have little confidence in their estimates and disagree substantially. The composition of the expert pool does not drive results. Experts can contribute new insights because they make predictions for specific migration flows and scenarios that are unavailable in official statistics. However, whether experts are more accurate than alternative approaches to anticipate migration remains an open question.

Even though there is on the ground information available about movement, we consider what can and cannot be determined using organic data sources. We collected social media data from Ukrainian language Twitter, geotagged events reported by the open source intelligence community and newspaper articles about the war. These data were aggregated into a set of variables and indicators that attempt to approximate what is happening on the ground.  We develop a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate which of our organic variables are correlated with actual migration flows as reported by the UNHCR and, just as crucially, what the lag period is between on the ground events and arrivals of migrants. We discuss both the strengths and weaknesses of this approach for just-in-time movement information.
