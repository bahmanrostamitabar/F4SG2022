          <div class="card-body">Supply chain management of health programs (financing, technical assistance, support, etc.) 
  tend to be siloed and fall within the following health areas: 
  HIV/AIDS, TB, malaria, sexual and reproductive health, 
  neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), non-communicable diseases
  (NCDs), and vaccines. Introduction of the COVID-19 vaccine 
  required different forecasting methodologies than is 
  typically used in immunization programs due to the different
  target populations and service delivery strategies. 
  This presentation will review the methodologies that 
  health programs currently use for forecasting and 
  supply planning for program related pharmaceuticals 
  and supplies and how they vary across health areas. 
  The presentation will further review how the differing
  strategies for immunization programs, such as focus on 
  children, goals and aggregated consumption, needed to be
  adapted and updated for forecasting for the COVID-19 
  vaccines. The presentation will also examine how the 
  different methodologies are driven by the differences 
  in goals, data reporting, and collections structures. 
  Lessons learned from adapting for the COVID-19 vaccines 
  will be discussed as possible solutions and strategies 
  for country immunization teams to adapt how they forecast 
  for childhood/routine immunization. As other adult, 
  non-target based vaccines come on to the market, 
  alternate forecasting methodologies can build on 
  lessons learned across health program areas to 
  provide more accurate forecasts for vaccines.</div>

          <div class="card-body">JSI has been leading an effort with other partners to strengthen supply planning capacity by LMICs for COVID-19 vaccines. A standardized tool has been developed that captures complete shipment, inventory and consumption data from currently 15 countries. 
This initiative, called the COVID-19 Vaccine Collaborative 
Supply Planning (CSP), is partnered with ministries of health
in 15 countries, PATH, VillageReach, WFP, CHAI, inSupplyHealth
, and JSH. The initiative has two main goals: 
1) Work closely with partners to provide surge capacity to 
help countries collect, aggregate, and triangulate 
various sets of data, and support them to translate 
these data into systems to support more agile and 
responsive COVID-19 vaccine supply decisions, 
particularly around the timing and quantity of 
needed shipments; and 
2) Strengthen country capacity for supply planning, 
and improve data visibility and processes for supply 
planning at the global, regional, and country level 
for routine immunization as well. 
This presentation will review the successes and 
challenges to the second goal. Topics will include success 
and challenges to ownership and governance, 
data use policy, conflicts of interest, 
partner engagement, and global-level 
visibility for decision making. The presentation will also
review similar success and challenges to country level 
Visibility and Analytics (VAN) development in for 
vaccines and how lessons learned from these efforts
can be applied to the global level.</div>

  time period several of the contraceptive products included
  in these partnerships have experienced either fluctuations
  in demand or supply constraints, creating uncertainty

  While some individual procurers developed forecasts

  reliable estimates of overall demand for the public

  planning. Using data from a variety of sources provided
  via this partnership, including data provided directly
  from manufacturers and national programs, this 
  coordination group developed a collaborative forecasting
  methodology to provide rolling, quarterly, near term (18 month) 
  forecasts to better understand the overall demand for these products, and share with manufacturers for planning. 
This presentation will describe the methodology applied using the available data for several years to provide quarterly near term (18 months) forecasts to the manufacturers of hormonal implants. This will be compared to methodologies developed for similar markets with less data visibility. Accuracy data for these forecasts will be shared as well as on-going efforts to transition this forecast methodology to a more robust data and analytics platform and expand to other product categories.</div>
